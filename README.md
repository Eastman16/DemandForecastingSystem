## Description:
This project is a sales forecasting system designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises. The goal of the system is to enable businesses to predict sales for their stores, leading to better inventory management and cost optimization. Data can be loaded from CSV files or directly from e-commerce platforms such as Allegro or WooCommerce. Before starting the analysis, users must define several key parameters: the type of business, the country of operation, the duration of the forecast, and its periodicity (e.g., weekly). Additionally, users must specify whether the store operates on trading Sundays, as this can significantly influence sales patterns. These settings allow the predictions to be tailored to the specific needs of the business, ensuring more accurate and effective forecasting.

## Technologies Used:
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Python + Flask
- Predictions: Prophet
